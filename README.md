# KoalaDigital Mini Wesbite - A simple 2-Page Website Template without CMS

This is self-contained 2-page Website for Portfolio, Resume, CV, Profile, Project Showcase.

Built with:

- NextJS
- ReactJS
- TailwindCSS
- Markdown
- **No CMS**

Once built, the static output files can then be **FREELY** hosted on GitHub, Netlify or SurgeSH.
The directory `out` is the root directory of the static website.

## Markdown Data source

The Dynamic data source are Markdown files is in the `content` folder. The files loaded from 2 places:

- For development or for live server-side rendering, they are loaded by `importMd()` and `getInitialProps()`. Read NextJS doc for more info.
- For HTML static output (`yarn out`), they are loaded by the `exportPathMap()` function. Read NextJS doc for more info.
- The `.md` content is loaded thanks to the `frontmatter-markdown-loader` plugin

For other static sections, it's no neccessary to have them in the Markdown content. Just edit them directly in the template.

## Theme, styling and TailwindCSS

**TailwindCSS** is a utility CSS framework. That means you don't need to write CSS. Tailwind provides all the CSS classes for you
to build your page.

To modify TailwindCSS's theme:

- Edit the file `tailwind.config.js`
- Run `yarn css` to produce the new `public/css/tailwind.css` file

There is also a `custom.css` file where you can write your own custom CSS when **TailwindCss** is not suitable
